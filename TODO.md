#### ELO Model
* Before 2003, no distinction in date between matches in same tournament! 
* Remove retirements from training set / testing set?
    * These are noisy, and create all kinds of problems!
    * Looks like we do better on testing set with these included in training set...(?)
* Look into carpet vs other surfaces for indoor.
* Include fatigue
    * Figure out which features to include!
    * Figure out how to represent injury / recovery
    * Include interaction(s) between age and fatigue
* Weight by games won 
* NOTE: Results look better than they actually are, because I've removed retirements and walkovers from test sets
* Head-to-head features
* Other features
